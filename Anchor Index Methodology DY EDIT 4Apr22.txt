Anchor ARK Space Universe - MethodologyThe ‘Space 50’ companies meet the following requirements to enter Anchor ARK’s Space Universe, thus becoming a planet:1. Must be a publicly traded company.2. Must have space-related operations that fall under the Anchor ARK’s galaxy groups/galaxies. 3. Must have at least 15% of revenue generated from space-related operations.4. R & D objectives that cover and are correlated with the space economy. After the publicly traded company makes it to the Anchor ARK’s Space Index, it becomes a Planet in the Anchor Universe. Each planet is analyzed through their annual, 10-k, quarterly and analyst projection reports. The conclusion is reached on % space revenues by looking at the planet’s segmentation of its revenue and R&D costs. The final % is generated using a model that includes aerospace revenues, R&D revenues, mission control revenues, GPS related revenues (for satellite players), and more. This number is then presented to the Anchor Board of Directors for review and approval. The triangular funnel represented above exhibits the Anchor Research Team’s approach and methodology to the Space Economy and players. The Anchor ARK Space Index is later generated consisting of 50 selected companies. These planets and the related background is summarized (companies) as below:   Other than the background information of companies, several other metrics were analyzed to draw conclusions and identify the ‘Anchor Stellar’ for each of the planets. These metrics could be characterized and generalized by using the following graphs:
